# Data-Science-for-Food-Environment

The idea of this challenge is to provide public administrators with an efficient predictive model.
Public administrations are indeed deeply involved in the issue of access to healthy food. To help overcome store-access barriers for instance, some states and localities have initiated programs providing financial assistance and incentives to attract more stores into underserved areas CDC 2011. The Federal Healthy Food Finance Initiative HFFI (adminÂ­istered by the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the USDA) has also initiated programs to improve store-access in underserved areas. A growing interest is thus shown in dealing with crucial health issues through the quality of the food environment.
They may really benefit from such a tool given that understanding changes in the food environment and variations across subpopulations may also inform the design and targeting of diet-related policies, including nutrition education to improve diet quality, as well as product design and marketing.
The aim is to deal with the impact of the food environment on precise health indicators. For that we consider the following challenge: predicting adult Obesity rates and Diabetes rates for each US county, based on information regarding the food environment.

The interest of such a tool is twofold:
  - predicting the prevalence of obesity and diabetes in themselves, in different situations, for the sake of anticipation (especially in terms of resources) or to raise the awareness of the general public,
  - producing a model with which the public administrator could play to get a sense of the impact of public policies or changes in the food environment (sensitivity analysis).
